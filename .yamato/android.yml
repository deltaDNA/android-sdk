# This job is equivalent to the old jenkins jobs android-sdk-release and android-sdk-release-tags-and-docs
# They were merged here as for a normal Android release we want to run both these jobs together always anyway.
# WARNING: This job pushes to the public GitHub, only run this to perform a release from a relevant release tag.
